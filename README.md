# G7Sprint1Deliverable

This repository contains the work conducted by Group 7 during Sprint 1. We focused on processing and exploring a credit card transactions dataset, with a primary goal of cleaning and preparing the data for further analysis. This README file provides an overview of our project, its objectives, and instructions for accessing and contributing to the repository.

## Project Objective

Our main objective in Sprint 1 was to handle a dirty credit card transactions dataset and perform essential data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks using the Pandas library in Python. Our tasks included:

1. Data Loading: Importing the raw dataset into a suitable environment for analysis.
2. Data Cleaning: Identifying and addressing missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
3. Data Exploration: Conducting initial data exploration to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distribution of variables.
4. Data Transformation: Preparing the dataset for further analysis, which may involve feature engineering or restructuring.
5. Training a Machine Learning Model: TBD
